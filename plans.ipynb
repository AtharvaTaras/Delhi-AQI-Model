    "  1. Parse wind speed → assume dominant advection direction (seasonal pattern or reanalysis u/v if available)\n",
    "  2. Create a 2D grid covering Punjab → Delhi corridor\n",
    "  3. For each fire detection: initialize Gaussian source, evolve forward using advection-diffusion\n",

    "**Purpose:** More realistic transport simulation using backward/forward trajectories.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model:**\n",
    "- Use HYSPLIT-style backward trajectory from Delhi on high-AQI days\n",

    "### 2.2 Candidate Model Architectures\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Model A: Gradient Boosting (XGBoost / LightGBM)** ⭐ Recommended for baseline\n",
    "**Strengths:**\n",
    "- Handles non-linear fire–wind–AQI relationships\n",
    "- Natural feature importance interpretation\n",
    "- Fast training, minimal hyperparameter tuning needed\n",
    "- Robust to missing values (if careful)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Setup:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: [fire_count_t, frp_t, wind_speed_t, wind_speed_t-1, aqi_t-1, season, ...]\n",
    "Output: AQI_t (regression) or AQI_spike_t (binary classification)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hyperparameters to tune:**\n",
    "- Depth: 5–8 (avoid overfitting short lags)\n",
    "- Learning rate: 0.01–0.1\n",
    "- Lag window: 3–7 days (optimal likely 3–5)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected performance:** R² ≈ 0.65–0.75 (regression); AUC ≈ 0.80–0.88 (classification spike detection)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Model B: LSTM / Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN)** (Advanced)\n",
    "**Strengths:**\n",
    "- Captures long-range temporal dependencies (lag effects > 7 days)\n",
    "- Native sequence-to-sequence modeling (no manual lag engineering)\n",
    "- Can learn nonlinear advection timing\n",
    "\n",
    "**Architecture:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input sequence: [fire_count, frp, wind_speed, pollutants] over 14–21 days\n",
    "↓\n",
    "LSTM layers (64–128 units, 2–3 stacks)\n",
    "↓\n",
    "Dense layers (32–16 units, dropout 0.3)\n",
    "↓\n",
    "Output: AQI_t+1 (next-day prediction)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros & cons:**\n",
    "- **Pro:** Automatic lag discovery, handles variable-length sequences\n",
    "- **Con:** Requires more data (~1400 rows available; borderline), prone to overfitting, harder to interpret\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected performance:** Similar to XGBoost if well-tuned; marginal improvement if lag relationships are complex\n",
    "\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Model D: Hybrid Mechanistic-ML (Physics-Informed)**\n",
    "**Idea:** Combine transport simulation + ML\n",
    "\n",
    "**Approach:**\n",
    "1. Run advection model → compute \"particle arrival at Delhi\" (probability / concentration on day t)\n",
    "2. Feed particle arrival as feature into XGBoost (alongside fire count, wind speed)\n",
    "3. Let ML learn residual patterns not captured by physics\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected benefit:** More interpretable, potentially better generalization (out-of-distribution fires)\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3 Implementation Roadmap\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1: Data preparation**\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. Merge delhi_aqi, punjab_fire, wind_speed on date\n",
    "2. Aggregate fire → daily count, daily FRP (by region if possible)\n",
    "3. Aggregate wind → daily mean, std per station or state-wide mean\n",
    "4. Parse dates, handle missing values (forward-fill wind if gaps < 2 days)\n",
    "5. Create lag features: aqi_t-1, aqi_t-2, ..., fire_count_t-1, ..., wind_speed_t-1, ...\n",
    "6. Create target: aqi_spike (binary) or aqi_t (regression)\n",
    "7. Train-test split: 80% 2020–2023, 20% 2024 (temporal split for time-series)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2: EDA + Feature correlation**\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. Correlation heatmap: fires vs aqi (by lag)\n",
    "2. Lag plots: AQI vs fire count at lag 0–7 days\n",
    "3. Wind direction rose + seasonal distribution\n",
    "4. Fire season (Oct–Nov) vs non-season AQI/fire behavior\n",
    "5. Identify \"smoking gun\" lags (e.g., fire_count_t-2 strongly predicts aqi_t)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3: Model training**\n",
    "```\n",
    "For each model (XGBoost, LSTM, Linear):\n",
    "  1. Hyperparameter grid search (5-fold CV on train set)\n",
    "  2. Train on 2020–2023\n",
    "  3. Evaluate on 2024 hold-out\n",
    "  4. Compute: R², RMSE, MAE, or AUC, precision, recall (classification)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4: Interpretation & diagnostics**\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. Feature importance (XGBoost SHAP values)\n",
    "2. Partial dependence plots (effect of fire_count on AQI, holding wind fixed)\n",
    "3. Residual analysis (high-error days → exogenous factors?)\n",
    "4. Temporal plot: predicted vs actual AQI 2024\n",
